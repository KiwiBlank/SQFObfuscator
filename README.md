# SQFObfuscator

## Description

Removes all comments from .sqf files and converts the content to an array of decimal unicode numbers.

In theory this is meant for use in ARMA, where [toString](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/toString) can be used to "deobfuscate" the code.

## Requirements
.NET Framework v4.7.2 or later.
